Choosing a service to store data can be confusing and overwhelming for a front-end developer.
What are all these acronyms? Are the Amazon services named strange on purpose? These and many other questions
await your journey into the back-end.

As a front-end developer turned full-stack, I've spent more time than I'd like to admit trying to figure out the backend.
Because the backend is harder to _visualize_, I struggled to understand how the pieces fit together. Luckily, I soon found
out I wasn't alone. There's a support group when confused front-end engineers meet called Twitter.

Consider this article a "choose your own adventure" piece. I'll ask questions about your requirements
and then present a few options. Before we can begin our journey, I must first explain the basics. You can
also jump to the [list of services](/blog/backend#list-of-services) directly.

```js
function parseISO(date) {
  console.log("things");

  return date.toISOString();
}
```
